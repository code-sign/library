            Interaction is a kind<br />
            of action that <br />occurs as two or more objects <br />have an
            effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way<br />
            effect is essential in the<br />
            concept of interac<br />tion, as opposed to a one-way causal<br />
            effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity,<br />
            which deals wit<br />h the interactions of interactions within
            sys<br />tems: combinations of many simple<br />
            interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena.
            <br />Interaction has different t<br />ailored meanings in various
            scienc<br />es.[citation needed] Ch<br />anges can also involve
            interaction.<br />> Casual examples<br />
            of interaction outside science include:[citation needed]<br />

            of any sort, for example two or more p<br />eople talking to each
            other, or communication among groups, organizations, nations or
            states: trade, mi<br />gration, foreign relations,
            transportation,<br />
            The feedback during the ope<br />ration of a machine such as a<br />
            compute<br />r or tool, for example the interaction bet<br />ween a
            driv<br />er and the position of his<br />
            or her car on the <br />road: by steering the driver<br />
            influences this position, by obs<br />ervation this information<br />
